# AQI-Calculator
Air Quality Index Calculator that determines the location's Air Quality ranges from Good to Hazardous. 
Project assigned by Neal Terrell from my CECS 174 class at CSULB.  

The python program used three pollutants to determine what the Air Quality would be for each provided location. 
The pollutants used are : Particulate Matter (PM 10, PM2.5) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). It can take multiple locations at a time.
